        The first, ready, is used by worker threads to tell the timer thread when theyâ€™re ready.
        The worker threads then wait on the second latch, which is start.
        When the last worker thread invokes ready.countDown, the timer thread records the start time
        and invokes start.countDown, allowing all of the worker threads to proceed.
        Then the timer thread waits on the third latch, done, until the last of the worker threads finishes running
        the action and calls done. countDown. As soon as this happens, the timer thread awakens
        and records the end time.
